This is a plain text paragraph describing the batmobile. The batmobile is a car with jets attached to it styled in the theme of batman. It is a feat of engineering. I have many fond memories racing around the streets of gotham chasing the joker in the batmobile. I definitely prefer the design from the dark knight, with the tank treads and whatnot. Yes indeed, you gotta love the batmobile, which is a car by the way. In case I forget to mention that it was indeed an automotive with wheels operated by the Batman. Blah blah blah.
